i got some file path in the linux terminal while using nmap command :
"nmap -p- -sV -sC 13.234.19.132"

where one of the file names where :
/cookie_dough.pcapng

I copied this path and pasted in a syntax:
http://13.234.19.132:8000//cookie_dough.pcapng

a file named cookie_dough.pcapng downloaded.

i opened the file and filtered it into html.
where i found:

i opened the first one and clicked on :
HTML Form URL Encoded: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
where it displayed:
    Form item: "uname" = "justin"
    Form item: "pass" = "majorockyou"
    
using the following command in linux i logged in:
ssh -p 2222 justin@13.234.19.132
and entered the password

i got connected 

i used the command ls.

and i found a readme file
"cat read.txt"
