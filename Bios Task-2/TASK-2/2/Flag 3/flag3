Using nmap command in linux terminal:
"nmap -p- -sV -sC 13.234.19.132"

(This command will scan a specific port on a target machine).

I got the file name which was specified in the terminal:
/fl4g.html

After that i copied this link and pasted it in a format:

http://<IP address>:<port number>/<file name>
where
IP address:13.234.19.132
port number:8000
file name: fl4g.html.

it looks like:
http://13.234.19.132:8000/fl4g.html

then the website displayed a message with :
Thought you would find flag here ?!

LOL. You are aldready inside my genjutsu

i thought some suspicious in this message and selected the whole text and clicked on inspect.
where i found the flag: flag{w4k3_up_t0_r3al1ty}
